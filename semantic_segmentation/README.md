# Semantic Segmentation using Fully Convolutional Networks

## Introduction
The FCN used is the one proposed in [this by Shelhamer, Long
and Darrell](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06211.pdf), whose code can be found [here](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org)

I'm using [Mapillary dataset](http://blog.mapillary.com/product/2017/05/03/mapillary-vistas-dataset.html), that has more images and labels (the most important for me being lane markings) than Cityscapes.
